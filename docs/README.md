## Zero-Config Example

The clap button is a custom element that can be added directly to the page. Here is a minimal example:

The example only works if your site is hosted on __localhost__ or with an [active subscription](#pricing) otherwise.
{:.note.smaller.mb2}

```html
<head>
  <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/clap-button"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <clap-button></clap-button>
</body>
```

This will render the following button:

[^1]: [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) is a popular online game that pioneered the "clicker" genre, where the main mechanic is clicking a single button. Much like clap buttons, it's using the fact that clicking something repeatedly is oddly satisfying.
